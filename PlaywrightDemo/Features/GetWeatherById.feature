Feature: Get WeatherById

@api
Scenario: Verify the Api response 200 for valid GetWeatherById request
	Given I have the endpoint '/data/2.5/weather' and the search param is 'q=Sydney' for GetWeatherById
	When I send a GET request to the GetWeatherById Url
	And I should get a response for the api call
	Then the response status code should be 200
	And the resonse should pass the schema for 'Response 200' for GetWeatherById
	And the value of the 'name' is 'Sydney' in the response
	And the value of the 'coord.lon' is '151.2073' in the response
	And the value of the 'coord.lat' is '-33.8679' in the response
